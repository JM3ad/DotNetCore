Welcome!

This is my current hobby project; to set up & deploy a site I can mess about with. Initially, the aim will be to implement a simple deception-based multiplayer game. We'll see how the family copes with that and see where we go from there...
The website will be a .Net Core server, with a React/Redux front end app.

TODO:
Finish game logic
Test & Confirm HTTPS redirect
Improve signalR robustness
Improve design - mobile particularly.
