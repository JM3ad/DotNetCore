Welcome!

This is my current hobby project; to set up & deploy a site I can mess about with.
Initially, the aim will be to implement a simple deception-based multiplayer game.
The website will be a .Net Core server, with a React/Redux front end app; please excuse the front-end rawness

TODO:
Improve signalR robustness - refreshing page shouldn't be so fragile
Improve design
Playtest!
Experiment with new game addition
